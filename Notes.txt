Phase 1: Setting Up the Foundation

Design Decisions:

Paradigm: Choose a programming paradigm for Voyager (e.g., imperative, functional). This will influence syntax and how programmers interact with the language.
Static vs. Dynamic Typing: Decide if variables will have pre-defined types (static) or be determined at runtime (dynamic).

Development Environment:
Set up a text editor or IDE comfortable for C development (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks).
Install a C compiler like GCC.

Phase 2: Building Basic Blocks

Lexical Analysis (Scanner):
Write a program (in C) to scan the source code, recognizing tokens like keywords, identifiers, operators, and punctuation.
Use libraries like ctype.h for character classification tasks.

Syntax Analysis (Parser):
Develop a parser (in C) to analyze the structure of the code, checking for valid syntax based on your defined grammar.
Consider using parser generators like Bison if you find manual parsing overwhelming.

Semantic Analysis:
Implement semantic analysis (in C) to verify the meaning of the code after successful parsing. This includes type checking and ensuring code logic is valid.

Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):
Create an in-memory representation of the parsed code structure using an AST. This tree-like structure will hold information about variables, expressions, and statements.

Phase 3: Core Functionalities

Variables:
Implement a symbol table to store variable names, types, and values.
Develop functions for variable declaration, assignment, and access.

Expressions:
Write functions to handle different types of expressions (e.g., arithmetic, logical).
Utilize the AST to traverse and evaluate expressions.

Statements:
Implement basic control flow statements like if/else based on the parsed AST.
Include functionalities for printing to the console and reading user input using C library functions like printf and scanf.

Phase 4: Building the Toolchain (Optional):

Consider creating a simple interpreter (in C) to execute Voyager code directly, translating the AST into machine instructions.
This is an advanced step, but it allows you to test your language without relying on a full-fledged compiler.
