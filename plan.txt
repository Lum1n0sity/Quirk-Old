Core Functionalities:
Focus on building the essential features of Voyager for console applications, like data types, variables, operators, control flow (if/else, loops), and basic input/output functions (print, read).
Lexical Analysis & Parsing:
Implement a lexer to break down code into tokens and a parser to understand the structure of your language. Libraries like PLY (Python) or Lex/Bison (C++) can help with this.
Interpreter:
Develop a basic interpreter to execute Voyager code line by line. This allows you to test your language as you build it.
Standard Library (Stdlib) Basics:
Start with a foundational Stdlib that includes essential functions for math operations, string manipulation, and user interaction.
